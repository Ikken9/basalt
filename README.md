## When is Basalt released?

For the past month I've been working hard to build up the foundation of which will be the start of Basalt TUI. The features are visible in the demo gif.

I am aiming to release the first version of basalt in 1-2 weeks from now, so before May 2025.

The first version will have a very limited set of features and will be
susceptible to changes at any time. The major drawback will be the inability to modify any notes.
